Focus on real-time live streaming cluster, advanced [srs][srs].

## Usage

For linux/unix-like os:

```
go get github.com/ossrs/go-oryx &&
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ossrs/go-oryx &&
$GOPATH/bin/go-oryx -c conf/oryx.json
```

Or, for windows:

```
go get github.com/ossrs/go-oryx &&
cd %GOPATH%\src\github.com\ossrs\go-oryx &&
%GOPATH%\bin\go-oryx.exe -c conf\oryx.json
```

About how to build and run at current directory:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ossrs/go-oryx &&
go build . && ./go-oryx -c conf/oryx.json
```

About how to set $GOPATH, read [prepare go][go-prepare].

## SRS vs go-oryx

Why rewrite the SRS to go-oryx:

1. Coroutine Or Goroutine: SRS base on ST, it’s more important than c/c++ language for streaming server; while golang support goroutine, which is actually what ST do.
1. Multiple Processes: SRS is single process. It’s too weak for modern server with 16 or 64 CPUs and 2 or 4 10Gbps network. Multiple cpus and network interfaces requires multiple processes server.
1. New Arch: New arch for HTTP/RTMP/FLV/HLS/RTSP or other protocol, it’s better to support many protocol especially private protocol, which will provides realtime streaming.
